			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and jQuery</h1>
			<div id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with jQuery and implement it into our website.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problem that arose was using "." instead of "#" as well as turning our class sections into id sections so that the "#" would work properly.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="results">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I didn't have many issues with this assignment. I understood the assignment and tried to understand exactly what each line of code did. I now know how jQuery works and how it can be used to help me in web design.</p>
