			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our task was to psuedocode and everyday task as well as a small computer game. We didi this by devising lists of instructions to cary out the necessary tasks needed to perform each action. If needed we broke down tasks into simpler smaller steps and subtasks. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Simplifying tasks into understandable and concise instructions s difficult. Especially with our example of getting gas at a gas station since we realized that there are multiple ways of getting gas at a gas station. We came togethter as partners to make decisiosn that made the most sense to us both.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Aside from minor confusion, the instructions to the lab assignment, my partner and I did a good job of compiliing our lists and Pseudocoding. We spent a good amount of time revising our work and psuedocode so it hit all of the requirements of the assignment.</p>
