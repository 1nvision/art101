			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our task was to psuedocode and everyday task as well as a small computer game. We didi this by devising lists of instructions to cary out the necessary tasks needed to perform each action. If needed we broke down tasks into simpler smaller steps and subtasks. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Simplifying tasks into understandable and concise instructions s difficult. Especially with our example of getting gas at a gas station since we realized that there are multiple ways of getting gas at a gas station. We came togethter as partners to make decisiosn that made the most sense to us both.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Aside from minor confusion, the instructions to the lab assignment, my partner and I did a good job of compiliing our lists and Pseudocoding. We spent a good amount of time revising our work and psuedocode so it hit all of the requirements of the assignment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>

					<p>This is our list for how to fill up your car at a gas station</p>
						<li>Locate nearby gas stations.</li>
						<li>Compare their prices, availability of gas pumps, and the gas station’s overall appearance (Is it shady-looking? If it is, pick a different option.)</li>
						<li>Drive up to a pump with your car’s gas tank close to the gas pump.</li>
						<li>Park the car, then turn off its engine.</li>
						<li>Follow the instructions on the gas pump’s screen.</li>
						<li>It will ask you to pre-authorize a payment method before selecting a fuel.</li>
						<li>After payment, select the appropriate fuel premium for your car.</li>
						<li>Open your car’s gas tank. You can usually do this by pressing down the cover, lifting it open, and twisting off the cap.</li>
						<li>Take the nozzle from the gas pump.</li>
						<li>Insert nozzle into the gas tank.</li>
						<li>Hold down the trigger on the nozzle to release fuel into your car.</li>
						<li>The nozzle will automatically stop fueling your car once the tank is full.</li>
						<li>Remove the nozzle from your car and return it to the gas pump.</li>
						<li>Screw the cap on your gas tank back in, usually until you hear a click, and then close the cover.</li>
						<li>Take your receipt from the gas pump.</li>
						<li>Get in your car and reset the odometer.</li>
						<li>Ensure your dash’s fuel display correctly reflects that you’ve filled the tank.</li>
						<li>If this is good to go, you’ve finished fueling your vehicle.</li>
