			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There were quite a few problems in this lab. The directions weren't very clear for this lab. The javascript was not working and giving errors in the console. We were able to get the JS working in the console eventually after adjusting the function names.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I have learned Anon Functions and Callbacks for this lab. I tried to understand what every line of code in the JS file meant and did but it was difficult to fully understand. I mainly referenced the lab 8 examples to help myself. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">The ouput is in the console.</div>
