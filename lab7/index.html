			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were tasked with creating a JavaScript function that would take a users name that they inputted and then sort it alphabetically. It would then call the function and print the sorted name as an output.</p>
		
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did not come across any issues in this Lab. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am familiar with creating functions and didn't have many issues with this assignment. I understood the assignment and tried to understand exactly what each line of code did. I mostly referenced the example screenshot from the Lab 7 assignment page.</p>
			
					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>When this page was opened it asked for you to input your username.</p>
                    <div>
