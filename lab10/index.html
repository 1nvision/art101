			<div id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problem that arose was forgetting a semi colon after one of the lines which made me confused for a bit. As well as not directing my html to the js file properly.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="results">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I didn't have many issues with this assignment. I understood the assignment and tried to understand exactly what each line of code did. I know how DOM works and how it can be used to help me in web design.</p>
			</div>
